## Machines

### WAVM — Analyst Workstation (Windows Server 2019)
User `LocalAdmin` / `Password123!` (admin, RDP enabled).

**Software:**
- Git (via Chocolatey)
- Autopsy / Sleuth Kit 4.21.0 (via Chocolatey)
- Strawberry Perl (via Chocolatey)
- CodeMeter Runtime (installed silently from GitHub release)
- FTK Imager (extracted to `C:\Tools\FTKImager`)
- DumpIt (memory acquisition; extracted to `C:\Tools\DumpIt`, Desktop shortcut on public Desktop)
- Sysinternals Strings (extracted to `C:\Tools\Strings`)
- SMB share `\\wavm\investigation` → `C:\Investigation` (Everyone read/write, share + NTFS)

**Notes:**
- FTK Imager is not installed via an installer — it is extracted directly to `C:\Tools\FTKImager` and run as a portable application.
- CodeMeter Runtime is required as a dependency for certain forensic tools and is installed silently.
